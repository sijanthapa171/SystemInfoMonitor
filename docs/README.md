# SystemInfoMonitor Documentation

Welcome to the SystemInfoMonitor documentation. This directory contains comprehensive documentation about the system's architecture, implementation, and usage.

## Documentation Structure

- [`system_architecture.md`](./system_architecture.md) - Contains detailed system architecture diagrams and explanations including:
  - High-level architecture overview
  - Component flow diagrams
  - Module structure
  - Data flow architecture
  - Implementation details

## Diagrams

All diagrams are created using Mermaid, a markdown-based diagramming tool. The diagrams are rendered automatically when viewing the markdown files on platforms that support Mermaid (like GitHub).

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:
1. Use Markdown format for text documents
2. Include Mermaid diagrams where visual representation would be helpful
3. Keep diagrams simple and focused
4. Add new files to this README for easy navigation
